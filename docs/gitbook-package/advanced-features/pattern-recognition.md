# Enhanced Pattern Recognition (v1.1.0)

Git-Smart v1.1.0 introduces advanced pattern recognition that learns from your commit history to provide highly personalized and accurate commit message suggestions.

## How It Works

The enhanced pattern recognition system analyzes multiple dimensions of your commit history:

### 1. Vocabulary Analysis

Git-Smart categorizes your vocabulary usage into four distinct patterns:

- **Formal**: `implement`, `optimize`, `refactor`, `enhance`, `resolve`
- **Casual**: `fix`, `add`, `update`, `change`, `make`
- **Technical**: `api`, `database`, `auth`, `config`, `service`
- **Business**: `user`, `customer`, `order`, `payment`, `product`

### 2. Scope Preferences

Analyzes your preferred scopes and categorizes them:

- **Frontend**: `ui`, `component`, `view`, `page`, `form`
- **Backend**: `api`, `service`, `controller`, `model`, `database`
- **DevOps**: `ci`, `cd`, `deploy`, `build`, `docker`
- **Testing**: `test`, `spec`, `mock`, `fixture`, `coverage`

### 3. Type Frequency

Tracks which commit types you use most frequently:
- Your most common patterns (feat, fix, docs, etc.)
- Usage frequency and patterns
- Trend analysis over time

## Enabling Enhanced Mode

Use the `--enhanced` flag to activate advanced pattern recognition:

```bash
git-smart --enhanced
```

This mode provides:
- **Higher Accuracy** - More precise commit type detection
- **Better Vocabulary Matching** - Suggestions that match your writing style
- **Improved Scope Suggestions** - Based on your actual usage patterns
- **Contextual Awareness** - Understanding of your project's domain

## Benefits

### Personalized Suggestions
```bash
# Regular mode might suggest:
feat: add user authentication

# Enhanced mode (learning you prefer technical vocabulary):
feat(auth): implement user authentication system
```

### Domain-Aware Scoping
```bash
# If you frequently work on frontend:
feat(ui): implement responsive navigation component

# If you frequently work on backend:
feat(api): implement user authentication endpoint
```

### Style Consistency
Enhanced mode ensures your commit messages maintain consistency with your established patterns:

- **Vocabulary Level** - Matches your formal/casual preference
- **Scope Usage** - Suggests scopes you actually use
- **Message Length** - Targets your typical message length
- **Tone Consistency** - Maintains your preferred tone

## Performance Impact

Enhanced pattern recognition:
- ✅ **Still 100% Offline** - No external API calls
- ✅ **Fast Processing** - Analysis completes in milliseconds
- ✅ **Memory Efficient** - Minimal additional memory usage
- ✅ **Backwards Compatible** - Falls back gracefully

## Combining with Other Features

Enhanced mode works seamlessly with other Git-Smart features:

```bash
# Enhanced + Interactive
git-smart --enhanced --interactive

# Enhanced + Analysis
git-smart --enhanced --analyze

# Enhanced + Dry Run
git-smart --enhanced --dry-run
```

## Learning Over Time

The more you use Git-Smart with enhanced mode:

1. **Pattern Recognition Improves** - Better understanding of your style
2. **Accuracy Increases** - More precise commit type detection
3. **Suggestions Refine** - Better vocabulary and scope matching
4. **Consistency Strengthens** - More cohesive commit history
